# Pokemon App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
This project uses [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

## The app's modules
### Pokedex
The main page, here you can find pokemon along with their sprites.
If you click any pokemon or type their name in the search bar and send it, you'll be taken to the pokemon's detail page.
