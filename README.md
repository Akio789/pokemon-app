# Pokemon App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
This project uses [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

## The app's modules :rocket:
### Pokedex
The main page, here you can find pokemon along with their sprites.  
The pokemon are paginated and can be searched by name.
